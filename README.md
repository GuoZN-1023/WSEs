This is the repository for WSEs research, including prediction, high-throughput screening, clustering and websites for WSEs research.

In app.py and templates, there exsit code for building the website
If you want to view the figure of 643 WSEs molecules, switich to static/images file
And for primary data of 643 WSEs, see the ideal_WSEs_0827.csv, there exsits the data you want.
Finally, KMeans_4 file contains the clustering results, including property, molecular vector, PCA coordinate of each molecules, brief figure of K_Means visualization and analysis for each cluster.
